		<h2>Organization of conferences</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><a href="https://www.ruhrsec.de">RuhrSec. </a></strong>I am a co-founder and co-chair of the annual RuhrSec conference. Since its first edition in 2016, the conference developed to the largest IT security conference in the Ruhr area.  </li>
			<li><strong><a href="https://crypto.iacr.org/2019/affevents/wac/page.html">Workshop on Attacks in Cryptography. </a></strong>In 2019, I organized the Organizer of the Workshop on Attacks in Cryptography in Santa Barbara. This workshop brought together researchers who work on cryptographic attacks. The videos are The talks are <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeeS-3Ml-rpo5tZgu7J2MhnrCJf0lSsqn">online.</a></li>
			<li><strong><a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2018/968/info.php3?wsid=968">Workshop on Systematic Analysis of Security Protocol Implementations. </a></strong> In 2018, I organized this workshop toghether with Joeri de Ruiter and Frits Vaandrager in the Lorentz Center. The aim of our workshop was to connect experts from different areas: cryptography, security, and machine learning.</li>
